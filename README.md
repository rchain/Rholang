Rholang is a concurrency-oriented programming language, with a focus on message-passing and asynchrony. It is designed to be used to implement protocols and "smart contracts" on a general-purpose blockchain, but could be used in other settings as well. It is based on the ρ-calculus, a reflective and higher-order extension of the π-calculus.

The language is still in the early stages of development, but for those who are interested, more information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/synereo/rholang/wiki).
